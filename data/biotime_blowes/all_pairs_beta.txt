Hi Malin

Please find attached a data frame with all pairs for the different metrics we have been using so far.

There are some slight name changes:
        - the â€˜_base' suffix has been dropped from all metric names
        - the year column is now two (year1, year2), which you can use to calculate the temporal distanse

Let me know if anything remains unclear.

Cheers,
Shane
