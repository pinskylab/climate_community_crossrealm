.RData has two objects:
- bt_grid_spp_list_abund
- bt_grid_spp_list_abund_year

Hi Malin

I’ve attached two versions of the species list with abundances:
- one with total abundance (all samples, all years)
- one with total annual abundance (all samples)

Neither of these are very satisfactory. Due to the resampling process required to standardise effort within time series, we’d need to do some more work to calculate an abundance-weighted community mass. 

Cheers,
Shane
