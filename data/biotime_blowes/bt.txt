Hi Malin

I’ve attached a simplified version of the gridded data.

REALM is one of terrestrial, freshwater or marine
Biome are the biomes used in the 2019 analysis
taxa_mod are the taxonomic groups we used in the 2019 analysis (and are somewhat simplified from the BioTIME database)
STUDY_ID is an identifier from BioTIME
rarefyID is the concatenation of STUDY_ID and the cell reference number from the gridding process
rarefyID_x is the longitude of the centroid from a convex hull around the data within cells
rarefyID_x is the latitude of the centroid from a convex hull around the data within cells
YEAR is the year of the observation
S is species richness
Jtu_base is the turnover component of Jaccard’s dissimilarity (distance from initial community).

These assemblage level metrics (S, Jtu_base) were calculated following sample based rarefaction. Let me know if you want more details or other assemblage level metrics.

Cheers,
Shane
