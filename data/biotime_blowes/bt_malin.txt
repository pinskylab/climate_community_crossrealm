Hi Malin

Here is an updated data frame with the Morisita-Horn index (called Horn_base); _base in these metrics refers to the comparison with the first year. Note that Horn_base is a similarity, so 1 - Horn_base gets you the dissimilarity for consistency with the Jaccard’s stuff. I also put total Jaccard’s in (Jbeta_base), as I think it will be more appropriate to compare total jaccard’s with the morisita horn if you go down that path.

Cheers,
Shane
