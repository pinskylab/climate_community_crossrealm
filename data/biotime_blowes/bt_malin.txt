Hi Malin

I’ve attached a simplified version of the gridded data.

REALM is one of terrestrial, freshwater or marine
Biome are the biomes used in the 2019 analysis
taxa_mod are the taxonomic groups we used in the 2019 analysis (and are somewhat simplified from the BioTIME database)
STUDY_ID is an identifier from BioTIME
rarefyID is the concatenation of STUDY_ID and the cell reference number from the gridding process
rarefyID_x is the longitude of the centroid from a convex hull around the data within cells
rarefyID_x is the latitude of the centroid from a convex hull around the data within cells
YEAR is the year of the observation
S is species richness
Jtu_base is the turnover component of Jaccard’s dissimilarity (distance from initial community).

These assemblage level metrics (S, Jtu_base) were calculated following sample based rarefaction. Let me know if you want more details or other assemblage level metrics.

Cheers,
Shane

Hi Malin

Here is an updated data frame with the Morisita-Horn index (called Horn_base); _base in these metrics refers to the comparison with the first year. Note that Horn_base is a similarity, so 1 - Horn_base gets you the dissimilarity for consistency with the Jaccard’s stuff. I also put total Jaccard’s in (Jbeta_base), as I think it will be more appropriate to compare total jaccard’s with the morisita horn if you go down that path.

Cheers,
Shane
