Species list for each grid cell attached. 
There may be extra cells here due to some filtering occurring during the resampling/rarefaction process.

That sounds good. I’m putting together a body size dataset, so just need to know which species to pull data for.

The summary statistics that I have given you are based on 200 resamples (to standardise effort through time) of the gridded data. How about a list of species for each grid before the resampling process?

Shane,

To pull together the body size and mobility data, I’ll need a list of taxa in each of the gridded BioTime datasets, ideally with their relative proportions. Is that easy enough to send so that I can start working on this?

I don’t need temporal data, but if it’s just easier to send the community matrices, I can work with those, too.

Thank you!

Regards,
Malin
